Vagrant part of the projet.

This Vagrant file will:
1. create a ubuntu 18 VM
2. setup networking and sync website folder
3. install update, git, nodejs and npm.

Just run `vagrant up` and enjoy :)

You will have to `vagrant ssh` go to /home/vagrant/projet-richam/webisite and run `npm install` and `npm next start` to start nodejs APP.
